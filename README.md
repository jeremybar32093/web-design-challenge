# web-design-challenge

This repository creates a simple website that displays climate data and some brief analysis. This website is also deployed to the web using GitHub Pages and can be accessed with [this link](https://jeremybar32093.github.io/web-design-challenge/).

The website includes the following content:

* A landing page containing:
  * An explanation of the project
  * Links to each visualization page, using a sidebar containing preview images of each plot - clicking on an image should take the user to that visualization 
* Four visualization pages, each with the plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison, and a quick paragraph describing the plot and its significance
* A "Comparisons" page that contains all of the visualizations on the same page so that they can easily be compared
* A "Data" page that displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations

The website was built using basic HTML, CSS, and the [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework.
